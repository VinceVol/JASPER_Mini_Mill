4. Share your CNC folder



On the LinuxCNC web interface, click Add Folder.

Point it to your G-code folder (e.g., /home/username/linuxcnc/nc_files).

In the Sharing tab of that folder’s settings, check the box for your "Ubuntu Desktop".

On your Ubuntu Desktop, a message will pop up asking where to save the incoming folder. Pick a folder on your desktop. 

On your Ubuntu Desktop, open your web browser to http://localhost:8384.

Go to Actions (top right) -> Show ID. Copy this long string.

On your LinuxCNC machine, open the same URL (http://localhost:8384), click Add Remote Device, and paste the ID from your desktop.

Accept the connection prompt that appears on your desktop.
